# AERMOD_project
This run of AERMOD simulates a point source on a drilling site in Broomfield from 19/3/1 TO 19/8/1
This is an example run to get familiar with the various pre-processors and basic options.

Receptors are configured on a polar grid with the origin on the point source. There are 3 rings of receptors, a 250m, 500m, 
and 750 m radius circle, with a receptor every 10 degrees. There is a total of 108 receptors. 

Pollutant: CH4

Upper Air data used for this model comes from Denver Airport. 
Hourly Surface Data comes from Akron Airport.
